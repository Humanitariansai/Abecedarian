## Summary of Work Completed

### 1. Extended Load & Reliability Testing
- Continued endpoint testing using batches of sequential curl requests.
- Performed small-scale concurrency tests (15–20 users) using ApacheBench (`ab`).
- Conducted multi-minute continuous requests to evaluate long-run stability.
- Monitored performance using `top` and CloudWatch to identify bottlenecks.

### 2. HTTPS Configuration
- Installed Certbot on EC2 and enabled HTTPS.
- Verified certificate issuance, renewal setup, and compatibility with Nginx routing.
- Ensured secure access to Ada backend without breaking API functionality.

### 3. S3 Bucket Integration (Optional Enhancement)
- Created an S3 bucket for storing optional static resources.
- Tested bucket access from EC2 and validated object retrieval.
- Enabled versioning for safe modification of stored content.

### 4. Security Hardening
- Removed unused ports and tightened security group rules.
- Cleaned unnecessary software packages and enforced basic firewall policies.

### 5. Functional Validation Across Topics
- Tested Ada extensively across calculus topics:
  - Limits, intermediate forms, continuity
  - Derivative rules (product, chain)
  - Curve reasoning and sketching logic
  - Basic integrals and substitution
- Ensured responses remain aligned with educational style and scaffolded explanation patterns.

### 6. Finalization & Handoff Preparation
- Compiled maintenance notes covering:
  - Starting/stopping the backend  
  - Updating environment variables  
  - Renewing SSL certificates  
  - Monitoring EC2 behaviour  
- Ensured the deployed environment is stable for faculty use and ready for future contributors.
